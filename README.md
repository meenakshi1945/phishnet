##  What is PhishNet?
<<<<<<< HEAD

PhishNet is a **real-time phishing detection system** that goes beyond just URLs.  
It’s a **hybrid intelligence framework** that watches over your web pages like a friendly digital guard dog 

>  *Think of it as your browser's personal bodyguard against sneaky phishing pages!*

##  Why PhishNet is Special

| Old School Methods | 🆚 | PhishNet’s Magic  |
|-------------------|----|---------------------|
| Only checks URLs | → | Scans **HTML, JavaScript, DOM, and behavior** |
| Misses hidden scripts | → | Detects **obfuscated payloads & iframes** |
| No explanations | → | Shows **why** a page is risky |
| Slow & offline | → | **Real-time + lightweight** on-device inference |
| URL-only ML | → | **Heuristics + Signatures + Lightweight ML** |

---

## How It Works 

1. **You browse** 
2. PhishNet **sneakily scans** the page 
3. Engines wake up:
   -  **Heuristics Engine** – “Hmm, this looks fishy…”
   -  **Signature Engine** – “I’ve seen this trick before”
   -  **ML Model** – “My spider-sense is tingling”
4. You get a **friendly warning + reasons**

##  Tech Stack 

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend | React / Next.js / Electron |
| Backend | FastAPI (speedy!) |
| ML | LightGBM, XGBoost, TF Lite |
| Signatures | YARA + ClamAV-style patterns |
| Heuristics | Entropy scanner, redirect tracker, DOM parser |

##  Key Features

-  **Real-time** page analysis  
-  **Multi-layer detection** (not just URLs!)  
-  **Explains** why something is risky  
-  **Lightweight** – runs smoothly on low-resource devices
